# GROS

GROS is a research operating system.  It is written in C and designed to
support multiple architectures.  The initial architecture target is
RISC-V.  The goals of this project are
  * to explore operating system design,
  * to learn the RISC-V instruction set,
  * to evaluate build system requirements for OS development,
  * and to discover pain points of using C for low-level programming.
